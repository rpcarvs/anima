# index: molecule id inside the database

# dielectric constants obtained from Clausius-Mossotti equation

# homo and lumo energies in Hartree

# Oxidation and Reduction potentials in Volts and referred to the vacuum

# Ionization potentials (ip) and electron affinities (ea) in Volts and referred to the vacuum

# The change in electronic energy for oxidation (deo) and reduction (der) reactions in Volts and referred to the vacuum

# The tag "_solv" in these thermodynamic quantities refers to a variant of these energies when the molecule were solvated in acetonitrile and considering the SMD solvation model.

# capacity in mAh/g

# redox_centers: anticipated redox centers from the SMILES analysis

# smiles: molecule SMILES

# redox_stable: check if the molecule has suffered a bond length change higher than 40% for closed neighbors (smaller than 2.1 A) from neutral to oxidized or reduced phases. If True, the molecule is classified as unstable.
