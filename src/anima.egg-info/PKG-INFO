# ANIMA

ANIMA (AdvaNced artificial Intelligence for Materials reseArch) is a machine learning code developed to work with Quantum Mechanics and Materials Science. For now, the main goal is related to energy materials and organic electroactive materials. The software includes a collection of tools and functions to process data in a
molecular or solid-state level and uses the processed data to build a ML model based on Neural Networks.
The user has the freedom to choose between our NN (see "models" class) or any external framework, e.g., Tensorflow/PyTorch.

Here are a few representations for the molecular/crystals systems available:
* Couloumb Matrix
* Many Body Tensor Representation
* SMILES

The SMILES package also contains a set of text-based functions in order to prepare the SMILES string
for a natural language processing (NLP) approach, if necessary.

### Dependencies:
This package is based on common python libraries, except in specific cases.
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas
* joblib
* sklearn (only used for a simple scaling and will be removed in a future version)

ONLY FOR THE SMILES CLASS:
* rdkit
* openbabel/pybel (version 3 or later is recommended)
* pysmiles

ONLY FOR THE AI-kernel model (in models module):
* pytorch (model was developed using version 1.7)

It is also recommended to install the dependencies in a new python-environment and using Anaconda.
